# Venmon
This Java project uses a binary search tree to model potential hosts for the symbiote Venom. Each host has compatibility traits, mental stability, and immunity markers. The program evaluates candidates and determines the most viable host using logical and structural analysis of the tree.

Features:
* Stores host data in a binary search tree (BST)
* Each host has compatibility, mental stability, and antibody resistance
* Implements queue-based traversal and host selection logic
* Reads data from input and simulates the Venom selection process
* Includes a driver class for I/O and tree construction
